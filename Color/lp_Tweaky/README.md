# lp_Tweaky

Provides a variety of little tweaking-options, like Vibrance, WB-Slider, Tint, etc.

### INPUTS

img = connect the main plate you want to treat

mask = masks the effect by a connected alpha-channel

### HOW TO USE IT

Just connect your plate and play with the controls, it's pretty straight forward :)

### HOW DOES IT WORK

Under the hood, the Tweaky transforms colourspaces left and right to give controls on things like white blance, tint, vibrance and other options you may or may not know from classic raw-development software.
