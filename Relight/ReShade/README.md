# ReShade

GPU Normal Based Relighting Pyplug using ShaderToy.

Input should be a normal pass (ZXY), based on Blender defaults.
You can set Diffuse , Specular (Phong) and Ambiant color separately.
Note that you need to have a proper Alpha Channel for ambiant color to work properly.

Thanks to Alessandro Dalla Fontana for the initial SeExpr code.
