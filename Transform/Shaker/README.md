# Shaker

Add a shaking effect to the input image. The effect is based on an expression similar to the wiggle expression known from After Effects.
There are also some options to extend the image when you are simulating a camera shake. This can help in some cases where you would have to zoom in a lot.

Thanks to sergusster for sharing the wiggle expression!
