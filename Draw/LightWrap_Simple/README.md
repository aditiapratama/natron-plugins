# LightWrap_Simple

An alternative to built-in LightWrap plugin, simpler to use, also it as an option to dilate wrap to get a bigger effect.

Built-in Pyplug as a lot of options to tweak colors of the wrap and add glow effects, 

if you just want to blend the edges of the forground over the background this Pyplug may just be enough.
