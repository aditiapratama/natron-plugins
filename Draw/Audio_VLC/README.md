# For windows users:
You have to set the VLC environment path in windows. To do this there are two .bat files in the folder Audio_Vlc. If you are using VLC 32 bit then double click the x86bit bat file. If you are using VLC 64 bit app, then doubleclick the x64 bit bat file. It will set the path for you.
