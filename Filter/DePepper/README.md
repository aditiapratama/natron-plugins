# DePepper

Remove Salt and Pepper noise.

Test images can be found at http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~vasicek/imagedb/23

Note: of course, if would be better to use the median of neighbor values rather than the average to replace the color.

If the noise covers several neighboring pixels, apply it two times.
