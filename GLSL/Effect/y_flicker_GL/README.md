# y_flicker_GL

If Remove: The 2nd input should be a locked frame frome the same clip as the 1st input. The locked frame should be at levels where you'd like to land the flicker free image. The Result is hopefully a flicker free front.
If Match: The 2nd input should be a clip you'd like apply the same flicker to, that already exists in input 1. The Result is a flickered Input 2.
